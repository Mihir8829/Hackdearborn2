        <p>Stonks:
          Buying shares of a company makes you a shareholder, allowing
          you to participate in the company's success and potentially
          earn a share of its profits. Stocks can offer the potential
          for high returns but also come with higher risk due to market
          fluctuations.
        </p>
        <p>Bonds:
          Bonds are essentially loans to governments, municipalities, 
          or corporations. When you buy a bond, you're lending money 
          in exchange for periodic interest payments and the return of 
          the bond's face value at maturity. Bonds are generally considered l
          ower risk compared to stocks.
      </p>
      <p>Cryptocurrencies:
        Digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have gained popularity 
        as alternative investments. They can be highly volatile and speculative, 
        so careful research is essential.
    </p>
    <p>401(k) or IRA Accounts:
      These retirement accounts offer tax advantages for long-term savings. 
      They often provide a range of investment options, including stocks, bonds, 
      and mutual funds.
