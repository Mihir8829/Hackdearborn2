      <h1>Stocks 101</h1>
      <h4>Step 1: Set Clear Financial Goals:</h4>
      <p>
        Determine why you want to invest in stocks. Are you saving for
        retirement, a major purchase, or building wealth? Your goals will
        influence your investment strategy.
      </p>
      <h4>Step 2: Build an Emergency Fund:</h4>
      <p>
        Before investing, ensure you have an emergency fund with 3-6 months'
        worth of living expenses. This safeguards you from the need to sell
        stocks in a financial crisis.
      </p>
      <h4>Step 3: Pay Off High-Interest Debt:</h4>
      <p>
        If you have high-interest debts (e.g., credit card debt), it's wise to
        pay them off first. High-interest debt can cost more than what you might
        earn from investing.
      </p>
      <h4>Step 4: Research and Educate Yourself:</h4>
      <p>
        Take the time to learn about the stock market, different investment
        strategies, and the companies you're interested in. There are numerous
        books, online courses, and resources available.
      </p>
      <h4>Step 5: Choose a Brokerage Account:</h4>
      <p>
        Open a brokerage account with a reputable brokerage firm. Research fees,
        account types, and available tools to choose one that aligns with your
        needs.
      </p>
      <h4>Step 6: Determine Your Budget:</h4>
      <p>
        Decide how much you're comfortable investing. Start with an amount you
        can afford to lose, as stock investments come with risk.
      </p>
      <h4>Step 7: Select Stocks:</h4>
      <p>
        Research and select the stocks you want to invest in. Consider factors
        like a company's financial health, growth potential, and industry
        trends. Diversify your investments by choosing stocks from various
        sectors.
      </p>
      <h4>Step 8: Place an Order:</h4>
      <p>
        Using your brokerage account, place an order to buy the chosen stocks.
        You can choose between different types of orders, such as market orders
        or limit orders, depending on your strategy.
      </p>
      <h4>Step 9: Monitor Your Investments:</h4>
      <p>
        Regularly review your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals. Be
        prepared for market fluctuations and make informed decisions about
        buying, selling, or holding stocks.
      </p>
      <h4>Step 10: Stay Informed:</h4>
      <p>
        Keep up with financial news, economic trends, and any developments
        related to the companies you've invested in. This knowledge can help you
        make informed investment decisions.
      </p>
      <h4>Step 11: Be Patient and Long-Term Oriented:</h4>
      <p>
        Understand that investing in stocks is typically a long-term endeavor.
        Don't expect instant results, and avoid making impulsive decisions based
        on short-term market fluctuations.
      </p>
      <h4>Step 12: Consider Professional Advice:</h4>
      <p>
        If you're uncertain about your investment choices or need personalized
        guidance, consider consulting with a financial advisor or planner.
      </p>
      <h4>Step 13: Reinvest Dividends:</h4>
      <p>
        If you receive dividends from your investments, consider reinvesting
        them to buy more shares. This can help your investments grow over time.
      </p>
      <h4>Step 14: Keep Records:</h4>
      <p>
        Maintain records of your investments, including purchase prices, dates,
        and any related documents for tax purposes.
